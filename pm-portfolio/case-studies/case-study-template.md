# Case Study: [Project Name]

> *Use this template to write retrospective case studies about shipped products. Follow the STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to tell a clear, compelling story.*

---

**Date:** *YYYY-MM-DD*
**Role:** *Your title and team*
**Company:** *Company name*
**Duration:** *e.g., Q1 2024 – Q3 2024*

---

## Situation

*Set the scene. Describe the context, market conditions, and the problem that existed. Help the reader understand why this project mattered.*

- **Context:** *What was happening in the business, market, or product when this project started?*
- **Problem:** *What specific problem were users or the business facing? Quantify where possible (e.g., "40% of users dropped off during onboarding").*
- **Stakeholders:** *Who cared about this problem? (users, leadership, partners, etc.)*
- **Constraints:** *What limitations existed? (timeline, budget, technical debt, team size, etc.)*

## Task

*Describe your specific role and what you were responsible for delivering.*

- **Your role:** *What was your title and scope of ownership?*
- **Goals:** *What were you asked to achieve? What did success look like?*
- **Team:** *Who did you work with? (engineers, designers, data scientists, etc.)*
- **Scope:** *What was in scope and out of scope for this effort?*

## Action

*This is the core of the case study. Walk through what you did, the decisions you made, and the tradeoffs you navigated.*

### Discovery & Research

*How did you understand the problem? What research did you do?*

- *e.g., Conducted 12 user interviews with enterprise customers*
- *e.g., Analyzed funnel data showing 40% drop-off at step 3*

### Strategy & Prioritization

*How did you decide what to build? What framework did you use to prioritize?*

- *e.g., Used RICE scoring to prioritize 15 feature requests down to 3 for MVP*
- *e.g., Made the call to cut feature X to hit the Q2 deadline*

### Key Decisions & Tradeoffs

*What were the hardest decisions? What did you trade off and why?*

| Decision | Options Considered | Choice Made | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g., Build vs. buy for auth* | *Custom, Auth0, Azure AD B2C* | *Azure AD B2C* | *Faster time to market, existing Azure investment* |
| | | | |

### Execution

*How did you drive execution? What was your working rhythm with the team?*

- *e.g., Ran weekly sprint reviews with eng, bi-weekly stakeholder syncs*
- *e.g., Wrote the PRD, defined acceptance criteria, triaged bugs daily*

### Challenges & How You Overcame Them

*What went wrong or was harder than expected? How did you adapt?*

- *e.g., Partner API was delayed 3 weeks — built a mock to unblock frontend development*
- *e.g., Stakeholder alignment was difficult — created a one-pager to align on scope*

## Result

*Share the outcomes. Use concrete numbers wherever possible.*

### Metrics & Outcomes

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| *e.g., Activation rate* | *32%* | *48%* | *+50%* |
| *e.g., Time to first value* | *12 min* | *4 min* | *-67%* |
| *e.g., Support tickets (onboarding)* | *80/week* | *35/week* | *-56%* |

### Business Impact

- *e.g., Feature contributed to $200K in incremental ARR within 6 months*
- *e.g., Enabled expansion into enterprise segment*

### Learnings

*What did you learn that you would apply to future projects?*

- *e.g., Investing in user research upfront saved us from building the wrong thing*
- *e.g., Phased rollout caught a critical bug before it reached 90% of users*
- *e.g., I should have aligned with the platform team earlier to avoid the 3-week delay*

### What I Would Do Differently

- *e.g., Start cross-team alignment 2 weeks earlier*
- *e.g., Set up automated metrics dashboards before launch, not after*
