# About Me

I'm a Product Manager at Microsoft working on the intersection of **API infrastructure** and **AI platforms**.

My current focus is building the **AI Gateway** layer in Azure API Management — the system that sits between enterprise applications and AI models, tools, and agents. This means defining how organizations govern, observe, secure, and scale their AI workloads through a unified gateway.

In parallel, I ship side products that solve real problems — like **[CostSeg Pro](https://github.com/anishtallapureddy/anish-projects/tree/main/cost-segregation)**, a fintech SaaS that generates IRS-compliant cost segregation reports for residential properties, helping owners save $10K–$100K+ in taxes through accelerated depreciation.

## What I care about

**Making complex systems accessible.** The best infrastructure products disappear — they just work. I'm driven by turning multi-team, multi-service complexity into experiences that feel simple to the admin configuring policies and the developer calling an API.

**Closing the gap between vision and execution.** I prototype aggressively, use data to make decisions, and write PRDs that engineering teams actually want to read. Every artifact in this portfolio is something I've used to ship real product.

**Building for the AI platform era.** The shift from "deploy a model" to "orchestrate agents with tools" is the most consequential platform shift since cloud. I want to be building the governance and infrastructure layer that makes this safe and scalable for enterprises.

## What's in this portfolio

This repo contains the PM artifacts behind my work — PRDs, decision logs, metrics plans, rollout strategies, and case studies. Each project folder represents a real (or realistic prototype) product initiative with the complete set of documents I'd produce as PM.

All live code lives in the [anish-projects](https://github.com/anishtallapureddy/anish-projects) monorepo alongside this portfolio.
