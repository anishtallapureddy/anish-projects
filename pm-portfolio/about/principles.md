# Product Principles

The beliefs and operating principles I bring to product work.

## 1. Ship to learn, not to finish
The goal of a v1 is to generate signal, not to be complete. Optimize for time-to-learning. Cut scope ruthlessly to get something in front of users faster.

## 2. Write it down
Decisions made in Slack threads and hallway conversations decay. Every consequential decision gets a written record with context, alternatives considered, and rationale. This scales trust across teams.

## 3. Prototype before you spec
A working prototype communicates more than a 20-page spec. Build the cheapest version that demonstrates the concept. Use it to align stakeholders, pressure-test assumptions, and discover edge cases.

## 4. Metrics are the product's memory
Without measurement, every launch is a fresh start. Define success metrics before building. Instrument events before shipping. Review data before planning the next iteration.

## 5. Serve the administrator AND the developer
Platform products have two customers. The admin who governs and the developer who builds. Great platform products make both feel powerful without making either feel constrained.

## 6. Make the default path the safe path
Don't rely on users reading documentation to avoid mistakes. Design systems where the easiest thing to do is also the correct thing to do. Security and compliance should be built-in, not bolted-on.

## 7. Compete on integration, not features
In platform markets, the winner is the product that works best with everything else. Invest in interoperability, standards compliance, and ecosystem partnerships before adding the 12th feature variant.

## 8. Respect the decision log
When revisiting a past decision, start by reading why it was made. Context changes, but the reasoning often holds. Update the record, don't just override it.

## 9. Earned complexity
Simple first. Add complexity only when you have evidence that simplicity isn't enough. Every configuration option, toggle, and setting is a tax on every user who sees it.

## 10. Show your work
The best PMs make their reasoning transparent. Share your logic, your data, your uncertainties. It builds trust and invites better input from the team.
