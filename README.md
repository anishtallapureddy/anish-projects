# Anish Tallapureddy — PM Portfolio

**Product Manager building governance, developer platform, and AI infrastructure products.**  
I ship enterprise-grade systems that make complex AI safe, observable, and easy to adopt — from gateway proxies to tool catalogs to cost controls.

## Projects

| # | Project | Problem | What I Shipped | Skills Demonstrated | Link |
|---|---------|---------|----------------|---------------------|------|
| 1 | **[AI Gateway Governance](./pm-portfolio/projects/01-ai-gateway-governance/)** | Enterprises have no unified control plane for AI models, tools, and agents — governance is fragmented across services | PRD · 32 user stories · architecture · 50+ metrics · 4-phase rollout · 10 ADRs · demo script · [live prototype](./ai-gateway-foundry/) | System design · Policy architecture · Cross-team alignment · Prototyping | [→ Docs](./pm-portfolio/projects/01-ai-gateway-governance/) |
| 2 | **[Cost Segregation SaaS](./pm-portfolio/projects/02-cost-segregation-saas/)** | CPAs spend $5K–$15K and 4–6 weeks on cost segregation studies that could be automated | PRD · user scenarios · metrics · risk register · rollout plan · 7 ADRs · [working MVP](./cost-segregation/) | 0→1 product spec · IRS domain modeling · Full-stack shipping |  [→ Docs](./pm-portfolio/projects/02-cost-segregation-saas/) |
| 3 | **[MCP Tool Catalog & Discovery](./pm-portfolio/projects/03-tool-catalog-discovery/)** | AI agents can't find, evaluate, or safely connect to enterprise tools — discovery is manual and ungoverned | Interview guide · 12 synthesized insights · opportunity tree · PRD · metrics · tradeoffs · decision log | Customer discovery · Search/catalog UX · Developer experience | [→ Docs](./pm-portfolio/projects/03-tool-catalog-discovery/) |
| 4 | **[AI Observability & Cost Controls](./pm-portfolio/projects/04-observability-cost-controls/)** | Platform teams can't attribute AI costs to teams/agents or detect anomalies before budgets blow | Hypothesis · experiment design · simulated results · decision · PRD · metrics · rollout plan | Experiment-driven iteration · Data analysis · Cost optimization | [→ Docs](./pm-portfolio/projects/04-observability-cost-controls/) |
| 5 | **[API Gateway Pricing Tiers](./pm-portfolio/projects/05-gateway-pricing-tiers/)** | Current flat pricing doesn't segment by usage pattern — small teams overpay, enterprises under-commit | Pricing model · competitive analysis · segment positioning · launch checklist · GTM plan | Pricing/packaging · GTM strategy · Business modeling | [→ Docs](./pm-portfolio/projects/05-gateway-pricing-tiers/) |

## Signature Strengths

- **Technical depth** — I prototype to learn. Every project above has a working demo or simulation, not just docs.
- **Governance-first thinking** — I design for the admin and the auditor, not just the happy-path developer.
- **Cross-functional execution** — I write specs that engineering wants to read and GTM plans that marketing can run with.
- **Data-driven decisions** — Hypotheses before features. Metrics before launch. Experiments before bets.
- **Velocity** — I ship small, learn fast, and keep decision logs so the team knows why we chose what we chose.

## How I Work

**Start with the problem, not the solution.** I run customer discovery before writing a single spec line. If I can't articulate the pain in one sentence, I'm not ready to build.

**Prototype to align.** Decks create opinions; working demos create conviction. I build throwaway prototypes to get stakeholder alignment faster than any review cycle.

**Write decisions down.** Every project has a decision log. When someone asks "why did we do it this way?" six months later, the answer is already documented.

**Ship in phases with kill criteria.** Every rollout plan has go/no-go gates. If the data says stop, we stop. No sunk-cost shipping.
