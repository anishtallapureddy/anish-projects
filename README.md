# anish-projects

A monorepo of things I'm building — AI infrastructure, fintech tools, and the product thinking behind them.

I'm a Product Lead at Microsoft, working on Microsoft AI Gateway to handle orchestratation for tools, models and agents in Microsoft and Azure products. This repo is where I prototype ideas, and ship side projects.

## 🔧 Live Projects

### [AI Gateway](./ai/ai-gateway/)
A working prototype of an AI governance gateway — rate limiting, content safety, semantic caching, PII detection, MCP tool routing, and load balancing across model deployments. Node.js + Express backend with a 23-page dashboard.

| Discover — Model & tool catalog | Operate — Governance dashboard |
|:---:|:---:|

| **Build — Agent management** | **Models — Catalog browse** |
| ![Build](./ai/ai-gateway/screenshots/03-build-playground.png) | ![Models](./ai/ai-gateway/screenshots/04-models-catalog.png) |

```bash
cd ai/ai-gateway && npm install && npm start
```

### [Cost Segregation](./consumer/cost-segregation/)
A fintech SaaS that generates IRS-compliant cost segregation reports for residential properties. Automates what CPAs charge $5K–$15K for. Next.js + TypeScript + SQLite.

| Landing page | Pricing tiers |
|:---:|:---:|

| **Property input wizard** | **Dashboard** |
| ![Property](./consumer/cost-segregation/screenshots/03-property-input.png) | ![Dashboard](./consumer/cost-segregation/screenshots/04-dashboard.png) |

```bash
cd consumer/cost-segregation && npm install && npm run dev
```

### [DFW CRE Investment Analyzer](./consumer/dfw-cre-analyzer/)
A data-driven dashboard that ingests live LoopNet listings across the Dallas–Fort Worth metro, scores each property on underpricing signals, and surfaces the best commercial real estate deals — ranked, mapped, and filterable. LoopNet API integration with 500+ live DFW properties.

| Top Deals — Scored & ranked | Map — Color-coded DFW markers |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![Top Deals](./consumer/dfw-cre-analyzer/screenshots/01-top-deals-dashboard.png) | ![Map](./consumer/dfw-cre-analyzer/screenshots/03-map-view.png) |

```bash
cd consumer/dfw-cre-analyzer && npm install && npm start
```

### [WheelAlpha — Stock Wheel Strategy Screener](./consumer/stock-wheel-strategy-screener/)
A multi-agent investing tool that screens stocks for wheel strategy income (cash-secured puts + covered calls), identifies undervalued long-term holds, and recommends ETF core allocations. Produces daily insights and **draft orders only** — human-in-the-loop, no execution. 8 sub-agents with config-driven risk gating.

| Opportunities dashboard | Draft orders with approve/reject |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![Opportunities](./consumer/stock-wheel-strategy-screener/screenshots/01-dashboard-opportunities.png) | ![Drafts](./consumer/stock-wheel-strategy-screener/screenshots/02-draft-orders.png) |

```bash
cd consumer/stock-wheel-strategy-screener && npm install && npm start
```

## 📋 Product Work

Each project has full PM documentation — PRDs, decision logs, metrics plans, rollout strategies. This is how I think through products, not just build them.
